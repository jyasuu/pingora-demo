# help me implement a generic solution feature for below issue in @src/bin/cors_proxy.rs

Yes ‚Äî this is a **known limitation** of running Rust WebAssembly (WASM) in the browser context.
Let‚Äôs go deep into **why** you can‚Äôt get the full HTTP response headers.

---

## üß© Root Cause

When your Rust WASM code runs in the browser, it doesn‚Äôt access the network directly.
Instead, it goes through the **browser‚Äôs Fetch API**, which enforces **CORS** and **security restrictions**.

### 1. Browser sandbox restrictions

Browsers **intentionally hide certain headers** from JavaScript (and by extension, WASM).
The Fetch/XHR APIs only expose a *whitelist* of "safe" headers.

These include:

```
Cache-Control
Content-Language
Content-Type
Expires
Last-Modified
Pragma
```

Everything else (like `Set-Cookie`, `Authorization`, `Server`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.) is **blocked unless explicitly exposed**.

---

### 2. Missing `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`

To access *custom headers*, the server must explicitly send:

```
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Custom-Header, Another-Header
```

If this header is missing, the browser‚Äôs Fetch API will **filter out** those fields ‚Äî
so your Rust WASM code (via `reqwest`, `gloo-net`, or `wasm-bindgen`) never sees them.

---

### 3. WebAssembly networking layer is not native

In Rust WASM builds, HTTP is done via:

* `wasm-bindgen` ‚Üí JavaScript bindings ‚Üí `fetch()`
* or crates like `reqwest` that internally polyfill to `fetch()`

This means **you cannot bypass browser limitations**, even with lower-level APIs ‚Äî
because your WASM binary *does not have raw TCP access*. It‚Äôs entirely mediated by the browser.

---

## üîç Example

Let‚Äôs say you write this in Rust:

```rust
use gloo_net::http::Request;

let resp = Request::get("https://example.com/api")
    .send()
    .await?;

for (key, value) in resp.headers() {
    web_sys::console::log_1(&format!("{}: {}", key, value).into());
}
```

Even if the response includes:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Request-ID: abc123
Server: nginx
```

You‚Äôll only see:

```
content-type: application/json
```

Unless the server adds:

```
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Request-ID, Server
```

---

## ‚úÖ Fix / Workarounds

### 1. Modify server CORS config

Add to your server response:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *
```

or explicitly list the headers you need.

### 2. Use backend proxy (recommended)

If you need **full header control**, proxy requests through your own backend service (Node, Go, Rust, etc.)
Then WASM ‚Üí your backend (CORS open) ‚Üí target server.

### 3. Run outside browser

If you compile your WASM to run in a **non-browser** environment (like WASI or WASIX),
you can bypass browser fetch restrictions and perform real TCP connections.

## üí° Summary

| Environment    | Network access | Header visibility | Notes                                 |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Browser (WASM) | via `fetch()`  | limited (CORS)    | needs `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` |
| WASI / WASIX   | real socket    | full headers      | no CORS restrictions                  |
| Native (Rust)  | full socket    | full headers      | unrestricted                          |

If you show me your current Rust+WASM HTTP client code and the actual response headers you‚Äôre missing,
I can help you confirm whether it‚Äôs a **CORS header exposure** or **Fetch API** limitation.
