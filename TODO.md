# help me implement a bin tool ✅ COMPLETED

## for proxy a service config from env vars ✅

## clean Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header ✅

## determine request header origin equal to a config from env vars. if so set request header origin as Access-Control-Allow-Origin then  response it. if no just response it directly ✅

---

## Implementation Details

✅ **CORS Proxy Tool Implemented** - `src/bin/cors_proxy.rs`

### Features:
- Proxies requests to upstream service configured via `UPSTREAM_ADDR` environment variable
- Cleans existing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response headers
- Checks request `Origin` header against `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable
- Sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header only for matching origins
- Configurable proxy port via `PROXY_PORT` environment variable

### Usage:
```bash
# Run with default settings (httpbin.org:80, port 6189)
cargo run --bin cors-proxy

# Run with custom configuration
UPSTREAM_ADDR="api.example.com:443" ALLOWED_ORIGIN="https://myapp.com" PROXY_PORT="8080" cargo run --bin cors-proxy
```

### Environment Variables:
- `UPSTREAM_ADDR` - Target service address (default: httpbin.org:80)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` - Origin to allow CORS for (e.g., https://example.com)
- `PROXY_PORT` - Port to listen on (default: 6189)

### Testing:
The implementation has been tested and verified to:
- ✅ Not add CORS headers when no origin is present
- ✅ Add CORS headers only for allowed origins
- ✅ Block CORS for disallowed origins
- ✅ Properly proxy requests to upstream service
